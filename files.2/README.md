# Site Craft — Next.js + Tailwind Starter

Quick start:

1. Install
   - npm install

2. Run locally
   - npm run dev
   - Open http://localhost:3000

3. Build for production
   - npm run build
   - npm start

Deploy:
- Best: Deploy to Vercel (connect your repo, Next.js is detected automatically).
- Other: Netlify supports Next.js with adapter or static export. For a fully static export run `next export` (adjust code and links accordingly).

What to customize next:
- Update `pages/index.js` and add pages in `pages/`.
- Add components to `components/`.
- Replace `public/logo.svg` and images.
- Update Tailwind config to match your brand colors.

If you want, I can:
- Push this scaffold to a GitHub repo for you.
- Add an About, Contact, and Blog page.
- Add a CMS integration (Sanity, Contentful, or Markdown-based).
- Configure Analytics, SEO meta tags, and image optimization.
